### **_Description_**

##### This is my mining game project. My goal was to create a game that allows for a relaxing gameplay that can be done while multitasking. The goal is to reach and mine the gold at the bottom of the map. Player has access to coal blocks which will increase visibility. Beware going deep into the mine without picking up coal!

### **_Getting Started_**

## To get started on creating this game, touch a js, and css file. Also open a HTML file and BANG!!!

##### Link your files in the header, don't forget to defer JS.

##### Create backgrounds for your html tags in order to see them on the screen.

##### Creeate variables for HTML elements in Javascript

##### Add JS event listener for the miner

##### Enable a counter in your HTML page that tells how many blocks you have mined

##### Create second html page named 'index.html' to display the instructions

##### add a theme and style using css

##### find a color pallete on coolor

### **_Inspiration_**

##### This game was inspired by doodle jump and temple run in that they are games where you must travel in one direction. Although mining-game allows you to travel in all direction, you principally move downwards.
